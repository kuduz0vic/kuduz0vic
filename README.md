Hi, my name is Arnes Kuduzovic and I am a 19-year-old front end developer.
I like playing video games, watching anime, and basically many more things that would be boring to read.
Currently, I know HTML, CSS, Shopify Liquid and JavaScript.Â 
Recently I've also been experimenting with codes like Python and Next.Js...
Feel free to reach out me via E-mail: arneskuduz3@gmail.com
