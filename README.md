Hii my name is Arnes Kuduzovic, and I am a 17-year-old e-commerce front end web developer.
I like playing video games, watching anime, and basically much more things that would be boring to read.
I develop websites on Shopify since Shopify is what I used before I even started programming. 
Currently, I know HTML, CSS, and Shopify Liquid. 
I am still learning JavaScript and a lot of its interesting libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, and similar...
